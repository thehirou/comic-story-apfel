Fast forward because Emilio’s life is pretty boring and no one wants to hear the constant looping story of a nine to five worker.
<br><br>
Emilio has a wife, she’s beautiful and perfect, he says.
Well okay don’t get too attached because she’s now dead, she died in a car crash in which Emilio was involved. His wife died, and with her, his unborn daughter.
<br><br>
Emilio is now depressed, duh, he isolates himself in his house, regretting what happened every single day of his life, he starts setting aside that skepticism he had for alchemy and starts taking it seriously, he created his own faith out of fear...
