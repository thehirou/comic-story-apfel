But Emilio is a scientist, he thinks logically, he knows that is not possible, reincarnation doesn’t exist… Yet.
<br><br>
He spends the rest of his life investigating every single aspect of alchemy, what everything does and how. In his solitary confinement he develops an immense hate for this world and the people that rule it; war, injustice, hunger, control, man-made horrors beyond his comprehension… Everything bad you can think of. Sometimes Emilio even thinks that his daughter is better dead, it would’ve been a shame to live in a world like this.
